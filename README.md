# The Cooper Test

### Author: Pedro Brás
#

The Cooper Test was developed by Dr. Ken Cooper in 1968 as an easy way to measure aerobic fitness. To perform the test the athlete must warm up for 10 minutes, then run at the highest intensity possible for 12 minutes. After the 12 minute run is complete just insert the distance that was covered, and the gender and age of the athlete.

#

## The project:

This project consisted on the creation of a full stack application for people to check the results of the above mentioned cooper test. The backend (API) was built on Ruby on Rails a and the frontend (client) was built on ReactJS.

#### [Visit the deployed app here](https://pb-cooper-test.netlify.com).

(Note: For the app to run properly accessing the API please fork the API repository [here](https://github.com/pedrocbras/cooper_api) and run it with the rails s command.)

#

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
